			<h1>Love poems to kira</h1>
            
            <p>So many poems to write

            Is this professional?

            You excite me,

            intellectually.
            
            If professing my love were a profession
            
            I'd put these poems on my CV

            and hope that you'd hire me! (lol)

            And I'd confess that I'd work for free.

            CC me in the email is you see these poems

            and like what you see.

            So many poems to write.
