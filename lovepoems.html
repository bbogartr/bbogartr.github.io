            <p style="color:rgb(212, 183, 87)">So many poems to write

            <br>Is this professional?

            <br>You excite me,

            <br>intellectually.
            
            <br>If professing my love were a profession
            
            <br>I'd put these poems on my CV

            <br>and hope that you'd hire me! (lol)

            <br>And I'll confess that I'd work for free.

            <br>CC me in the email if you see these poems

            <br>and like what you see.

            <br>So many poems to write.
