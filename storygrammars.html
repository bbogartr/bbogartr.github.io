                        At the level of the story, structure may emerge which connects 
                        otherwise disparate parts. The mental respresntation of the
                        whole of the story is refered to as the situation model.

                        Event Segmentation theory focuses on the events, but something
                        must link events together in memory to form a situation model.
                        
                        I put together these graphs to index locations in a story
                        where listeners will likely be linking parts of the story
                        via causal connnections.
                        I then counted the number of nodes on each sentence
                        to get a sense of "how important" each sentence was to the plot.

                        Previous researchers like Trabasso and Sperry (1985) and
                        Van den Broek et al (1999), have suspected these links
                        are important for comprehension.
                    
                        These tree diagrams of the causal connections copy what
                        Trabasso and Sperry, 1985 did. This time I'm doing it for
                        larger stories. The diagrams get out of hand.

                        These may also offer an interesting way to understand how
                        events are linked in situation models. 
                        
                        I've added some images of these trees below.
