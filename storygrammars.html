                        If you are reading a story, how do you know whether
                        this part is important or not?
                        
                        The answer to the question lies in how you
                        represent the story in memory. This is what
                        we want to know.
                    
                        My lab is putting together a series of studies
                        using a variety of techniques to quantify the
                        importance of each part of the story.
                        We plan to look at brain processes by recording EEG
                        while participants listen to folktales.

                        The hope is that by doing this research we will find
                        new ways to see what helps or hinders people's understanding
                        of narratives. 
                        
                        I've added some images from the project below.
