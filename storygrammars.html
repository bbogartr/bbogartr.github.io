                        I am putting together this study to behaviorally index
                        locations in a story or narrative where listeners will
                        likely be adjusting their memories for the whole story structure.
                        Sentence recognition questions answered at the end give us
                        a good idea about which parts were best remembered -- parts
                        we suspect would be times to look at later.

                        Soon we will move on to EEG (electroencephalographic) recording.
                        Then we will hopefully get some sort of index for what is happening
                        in the brain as people update their knowledge of a story in real time.
                        
                        In addition to behavioral indexes of memory, I've been making
                        tree diagrams of the causal connections like Trabasso & Sperry, 1985.
                        These may also offer an interesting a priori idea of when the magic of
                        updating is occuring.
                        
                        I've added some images of these trees below.
                        Enjoy and check back for more on this project!
