                        If you are reading a story, how do you know whether
                        this part is important or not?
                        
                        The answer to the question lies in how you
                        represent the story in memory.
                        How do you do this?
                    
                        My lab is putting together a series of studies to find out.
                        We are going to be using a variety of techniques
                        to quantify the imortance of each part of the story.
                        We plan to look at brain processes by recording EEG
                        while participants listen to folktales.

                        The hope is that by doing this research we will find
                        new ways to see what helps or hinders people's understanding
                        of narratives. 
                        
                        I've added some images from the project below.
