                <a><pe>What processes do you use to build a story you hear or read?
                    The answer is inference processes, particularly bridging inferences which connect
                    this part of the story with what came earlier in it. What does the brain use to do this?
                    
                    My lab is helping put together a study to look at this. We are going to be using a variety
                    of techniques to quantify the hypothesized likelihood that a bridgning inference will be made.

                    To do this, we are relying on both causal story grammars (Trebasso & Sperry, 1985) and other
                    techniques. We plant to look at brain processes yusing EEG, recorded while participants listen
                    to a variety of folktales (5-8 minutes in length).
