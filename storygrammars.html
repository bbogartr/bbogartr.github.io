                    <pe>If you are reading a story, how do you know whether
                        this part is important or not?
                        The answer to the question lies in how you represent the story in memory.
                        What does the brain use to do this?
                    
                        My lab is putting together study to help find out.
                        We are going to be using a variety of techniques
                        to quantify the imortance of each part of the story.
                        We then plan to look at brain processes using EEG,
                        recorded while participants listen to a variety
                        of folktales (5-8 minutes in length).
                        
                        I've added some images from the project below.
                        more will follow as we make progress!
