				Hi, I'm Ben. I'm from New Hope, Pennsylvania. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 2009, a master's degree from the University of Oregon in 2017,
				and my PhD in 2023 in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science at the University of Maryland.
				<br>
				<br>
				While in college I became interested in how linguistics and neuroscience could be used to improve our understanding of psychology.
				<br>
				This underlying goal has taken me across the academic universe and the United States,
				and graced me with the guidance of sage mentors. 
				<br>
				This path has lead me to look at how language interfaces with memory.
				<br>
				<br>
				In addition to language processing, this focus naturally leads to questions of how neuroscience can be used to quantify our subjective experiences of imagining, remembering, and knowing.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				My current research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to probe the biological mechanisms underlying narrative comprehension.
				My other research interests include the psychological phenomena surrounding word learning from context.
				<br>
				<br>
				This work lends itself to understanding the limitations and possibilities of EEG and neurotech applications. 
				My hope is to apply my knowledge to improve education, communcation, and health and wellnessin general.
				<br>
				<br>
				My hobbies include cooking and riding bikes with my amazing partner, watching movies, and tinkering with electronics.
