            My name's Benjamin Bogart Rickles. I go by Ben. I was born in 1987 in Trenton, NJ, and grew up in New Hope, PA.
            <br>I live in College Park, MD. Before that I lived in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Eugene. I have had many jobs,
            <br>but my career has sofar been trying to use cognitive electrophsyiology, to study language.
            <br>this started in a lab looking at single word recognition, then my masters work looking at sentence processing.
            <br>Now I am at the University of Maryland, studying how people remember and attend narratives (stories).
            <br>Please check back for updates!
