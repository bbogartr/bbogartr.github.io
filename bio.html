            My name's Benjamin Bogart Rickles. I go by Ben. I was born in 1987 in Trenton, NJ, and grew up in New Hope, PA.
            I live in College Park, MD. Before that I lived in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Eugene. I have had many jobs,
            but my career has sofar been aimed toward studying the neural bases of language use and dysfunction.
            This started when I joined a lab in college looking at word learning.
            Later, my masters work invesitaged sentence processing.

            Now I am at the University of Maryland, in the NACS program, still studying word learning in addition to narrative comprehension.
            To do this, I use a variety of techniques, behavioral, computational and physiological.
            My hope is to apply these skills to help understand why communication is often such a challenge
            and how cognitive science may be applied to improve it.
            </pre>
            <br>I recently became a PhD candidate (3/1/2021). Please check back for updates!
