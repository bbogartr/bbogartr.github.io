            My name's Benjamin Bogart Rickles. I go by Ben. I was born in 1987 in Trenton, NJ, and grew up in New Hope, PA.
            <br>I live in College Park, MD. Before that I lived in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Eugene. I have had many jobs,
            <br>but my career has sofar been aimed toward studying the neural bases of language use and dysfunction.
            <br>This started when I joined a lab in college looking at word learning.
            <br>Later, my masters work invesitaged sentence processing.
            <br>Now I am at the University of Maryland, in the NACS program, still studying word learning in addition to narrative comprehension.
            <br>To do this, I use a variety of techniques, both behavioral, computational, and physiological.
            <br>My hope is to apply these skills to help understand why communication is often such a challenge
            <br>and how cognitive science may be applied to improve it.

            <br>I recently became a PhD candidate (3/1/2021). Please check back for updates!
