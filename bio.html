				My name's Ben Rickles. I'm from New Hope, Pennsylvania. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 2009, a master's degree from the University of Oregon in 2017,
				and my PhD in 2023 in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science at the University of Maryland.
				<br>
				<br>
				My current research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to probe the biological mechanisms underlying narrative comprehension.
				My other research interests include the psychological phenomena surrounding word learning from context.
				<br>
				<br>
				My hope is to apply my knowledge to improve neurotech in the healthcare industry.
				<br>
				<br>
				My hobbies include cooking elaborate meals with my amazing partner, watching movies, tinkering with electronics,
				and riding my bike around Jupiter, Florida.
				<br>
				<br>

				I'm currently looking for a job so let me know if you're hiring!
