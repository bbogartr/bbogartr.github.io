				Hi, I'm Ben. I'm from New Hope, Pennsylvania. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 2009, a master's degree from the University of Oregon in 2017,
				and my PhD in 2023 in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science at the University of Maryland.
				<br>
				<br>
				While reading poetry in college I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness,
				starving hysterical naked,
				unable to communicate, think, or perhaps both.
				From these observations I turned to psychology and neuroscience to explain language disorder.
				<br>
				I steeped myself in cognitive psycholinguistics, psychology, and neuroscience.
				This underlying goal has taken me across the academic universe and the United States,
				and graced me with the guidance of sage mentors. 
				<br>
				This path has lead me to look at how language interfaces with memory to aid communication.
				<br>
				In addition to language processing, this focus naturally leads to questions of how neuroscience can be used to quantify our subjective experiences of imagining, remembering, and knowing.
				<br>
				As part of this interest I am also looking for new ways to measure "mental representations" as they occur using neurophysiological methods.
				<br>
				<br>
				My current research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to probe the biological mechanisms underlying narrative comprehension.
				My other research interests include the psychological phenomena surrounding word learning from context.
				<br>
				<br>
				This work lends itself to understanding the limitations and possibilities of EEG and neurotech applications. 
				My hope is to apply my knowledge to improve neurotech in the healthcare and education industry, or to increase conceptual knowledge about human communication.
				<br>
				<br>
				My hobbies include cooking elaborate meals and riding bikes with my amazing partner, watching movies, and tinkering with electronics.
