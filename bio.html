            My name's Benjamin Bogart Rickles. I'm from New Hope, Pennsylvania. I received my undergraduate degree from Pitt in 2009, a master's degree from University of Oregon in 2017,
			and my PhD in 2023 from the NACS program at UMD. My home department is Human Development and Quantitative Methodology within the College of Education.
			My current research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to probe the biological mechanisms underlying narrative comprehension.
			My other research interests include the psychological phenomena surrounding word learning from context.
			
			I also recently designed a paradigm to utilize both eye-tracking and EEG to examine implicit relevance feedback in a virtual reality environment.
			
			As a research assistant in the LEAD lab, I help out with programming experimental tasks, and data analysis.
			
			When I am not working I am cooking elaborate meals with my amazing partner, watching movies, tinkering with electronics, running a plastic recycling company,
			and riding my bike around the DMV.

            My hope is to apply my knowledge to better understand why communication is often such a challenge
            and how cognitive science may be applied to improve it.

            <br>  I'm moving to Florida in June of 2023 and I will be looking for a job.
