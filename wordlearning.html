                    <pre>
                        Most words we know we learn from context.
                        Adult readers pick up new vocabulary words
                        as they go about their day, starting with familiarity,
                        and ending with the ability to define the word, and use it.

                        We wanted to see how a word accumulates meaning
                        after multiple exposures to the word in context,
                        so we invited people to learn the meanings of unfamiliar words
                        in a viariety of sentence and non-sentence contexts.
                        
                        Borrowing from work done previously, our lab probed
                        semantic associations that were <h style="color: aqua;"> deep</h>  (conceptual)
                        or <h style="color: coral;"> shallow</h> (surface level).

                        To look at memory consolidation, we also probed semantic associations at two times,
                        both immediately after reading and one week later.

                        I've added some images from the project below.
