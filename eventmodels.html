                    I am using EEG to test event model theories of narrative comprehension.
                       
                    In case you are not familiar with this I can explain:
                    
                    While most theories of narrative comprehension agree that it requires mental representations,
                    Event cognition centers these mental representations around the sub-events of narrative.
                    These events, and their mental models, roughly correspond to the actions of the characters
                    which have clear beginnings and ends.
                    
                    These event model theories, combined with fMRI evidence has lead to certain 
                    hypotheses about what the brain is doing to support these event models.
                    These neurocognitive processes surround the binding and storage of event models in memory,
                    not to mention the contextual effects on perception. 
                   
                    As part of my thesis research, I have designed a study in order to use EEG to
                    watch neural effects of event model construction in real time, as people listen to folktales.
                    
                    This is an exciting application of EEG to cognitive research.
                    I imagine there are many applications to education, psychology, and art.
