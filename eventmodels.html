                       I am studying event model theories of narrative comprehension using EEG.
                       
                        in case you are not familiar with this I can explain:

                        Narrative (story) comprehension requires many memory processes:
                       
                       -to remember what's going on in a scene (seconds/minutes)
                       -to remember the beginnings of stories (minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/years)

                       How do these processes work together in order to remember stories?

                    In order to keep track of what is going on in the story, theories of 
                    event cognition have proposed that windows of working memory (WM) open
                    for a few seconds or minutes to allow memory for "events", before closing
                    after the event being described has either changed or been completed.
                    According to these theories, working memory representations for each event
                    are packaged and stored separately in long-term memory (LTM).
                    
                    According to these theories what happens when a new event begins in a story
                    (for example, when a character embarkson a long journey) is analogous to
                    how you might walk into a room and forget what you were looking for;
                    previous WM representations ("I'm looking for a pencil, pencil, pencil"),
                    have been closed when a change (location shift to new room) has occurred.
                   
                    As part of my thesis research, I have designed a study in order to use EEG to
                    watch neural WM and LTM effects in real time, as people listen to stories.
                    This is an exciting application of EEG to cognitive research with what I
                    imagine are many applications to education, psychology, and art. 

                    I will add updates as we continue.
